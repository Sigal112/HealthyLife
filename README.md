# üçé HealthyLife üçé

It was a final project in my web course.

I had to use skills I learned in HTML,ejs, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js

The purpose of the site is to help people calculate their BMI and the daily caloric that they need to eat.

The site has 3 pages:
1. Home page: Explanation
2. BMI Calculator: This page has an explanation of the calculator and values, you must enter your  height and weight.
3. Calorie Calculator: This page has an explanation of the calculator, you need to enter your age, height, weight, sex and how many workouts you perform per week.
